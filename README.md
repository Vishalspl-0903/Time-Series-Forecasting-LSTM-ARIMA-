## Time Series Forecasting using Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM with ADMM Optimization

Overview

This project focuses on improving time series forecasting by combining ARIMA for linear dependencies and LSTM for non-linear patterns. The hybrid model is further optimized using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for faster convergence and improved accuracy.

Features

Hybrid Model: Combines ARIMA and LSTM for comprehensive pattern detection.

ADMM Optimization: Enhances the model's performance with faster convergence.

Robust Forecasting: Achieves better results in financial data, climate predictions, etc.
